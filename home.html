            <h1>Can Adolescents Catch COVID-19?</h1>
            <p>
              Yes. All age groups can catch COVID-19. While we are still
              learning about how COVID-19 affects people, so far, data suggests
              that children under the age of 18 years have few deaths compared
              to other age groups and usually mild disease. However, cases of
              critical illness have been reported. As with adults, pre-existing
              medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung
              problems, asthma, diabetes, obesity, cancer and neurological and
              developmental conditions are risk factors for severe disease and
              intensive care admission in children.

              Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?
            </h1>
            <p>
              Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on
              bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so
              antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means
              of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. <br />
              In hospitals, physicians will sometimes use antibiotics to prevent
              or treat secondary bacterial infections which can be a
              complication of COVID-19 in severely ill patients. They should
              only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial
              infection.

              When will this pandemic end so things can go back to normal?
            </h1>
            <p>
              We don’t know when the pandemic will end, but we know it depends
              on every person’s contribution in helping stop the spread of the
              virus. The sacrifices you have made by not seeing your friends and
              by not going to school for a while, and other activities, are your
              contributions to fighting the pandemic. By putting societies and
              economies on hold, we have reduced the ability of the virus to
              spread through our communities. These defensive measures have
              helped to limit the damage the virus can cause, and bought us time
              to learn more about the virus and find solutions so that we can
              get back to a more familiar way of living. This is why it was
              possible to reopen schools and businesses in many places. It is
              important that you continue to practice the recommended measures
              and encourage your friends to do the same to prevent the situation
              from getting worse.

              What should I do if someone in my family gets really ill with
              COVID-19?
            </h1>
            <p>
              Immediately seek medical care if a member of your family gets
              seriously ill, for example develops difficulty breathing or feels
              pain or pressure in the chest. If possible, either you or an adult
              should contact your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for
              instructions and find out where and how you could get care. If
              your family member is confirmed as having COVID-19, you must be
              prepared that you and other known contacts will need to isolate
              for 14 days and monitor symptoms, even if you feel healthy.
